#The token used when you log in will periodically expire, and you will need to log in
again when it does. When this occurs, you can run oc login with no options:
> oc login
Login failed (401 Unauthorized)
You must obtain an API token by visiting
https://192.168.99.101:8443/oauth/token/request

>login

>display token

Log in with this token
oc login --token=KQUg264_zfLtpoQ-6eRpV00cLXmw0PPBCG4-prENqX4 --server=https://192.168.99.101:8443
Use this token directly against the API (as shown below)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer KQUg264_zfLtpoQ-6eRpV00cLXmw0PPBCG4-prENqX4" "https://192.168.99.101:8443/oapi/v1/users/~"

PS C:\Users\Win10> oc login --help

#To get a list of all the commands that oc accepts
PS C:\Users\Win10> oc help

#For details on common options accepted by all commands, run it with the options
command:
PS C:\Users\Win10> oc options
Many commands will accept --dry-run as an option.

#Using the OpenShift REST API
When you use the web console or oc command-line tool, it communicates with
OpenShift using a REST API endpoint. You can also access this REST API directly
using a simple HTTP client, or by using a custom client for a specific programming
language generated from the Swagger API specification for OpenShift.
The same access token used when logging in from the command line can be used
when making an HTTP call against the REST API. This token should be included as
part of the value for the Authorization header sent with the HTTP request.

C:\Users\Win10>curl -H "Authorization: Bearer O5r2NOUZXet1Km8OdUjxvqHrmdZYzEmMTydkpCCavC8" "https://192.168.99.101:8443/oapi/v1/users/~" --insecure
